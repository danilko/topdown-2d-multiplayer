What is working
======

- Basic top down shooter can attack and record health throughout network
- Basic network skeleton based on Authoritative Server network design with snapshot
- Basic audio and some basic effects 
- Basic enemy AI base on A* search and avoid collision with each other by disable collision between enemy
- Basic flocking/steer behavior (still need to improve)
- Weapon switch ability and framework (to support expansion of new weapon): laser/rifile/homing missles
- Destructible Obstacles
- Basic game flow conditions (base on exinging agent counts from bots and players)
- Support of game time period and expire (force winning condition base on available agents on the battlefied at that point) of 15 seconds and at server control (so server will sync time against connected client)
- Support of team concept (fridend firing vs firing from other teams), captured bases as spawn point, available spawn points + unit cost as condition whatever a team can generate new unit
- Support of capturable bases and team will spawn from captured bases or from neutral condition
- Try to balance AIs from each team (if team have available conditions to genrate new unit)

Current Ending Game Condition
======
- Destroy all units from other teams (each team can be tweak to output different amounts of units + inital bases)
- Capture all bases (so other team cannot spawn new unit)
- Time is up (it is a tie if there are more than one team with units on the field during that time)


Limitation
======
The total units on the game at once cannot exceed 20 units for workable performance, otherwise may start to see noticeable slow down. This may due to as the unit increases, a single snapshot package contain all units deployments will be larger than a udp packet able to handle, result delays on the client side when receiving the package and cause delay in screen

TODO
======
- The bot is equip with basic AI, but still not good with collision avoidance with each other (workaround now with no collision to save AI resource (there is basic code avoidance also in there can be enabled if need))
- Better Game Play
- Code clean up and more documentation (comments etc)
